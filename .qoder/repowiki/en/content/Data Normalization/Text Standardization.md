## Introduction
Text standardization is a critical step in data normalization pipelines, ensuring consistency across heterogeneous insurer data sources. This document details the process of converting raw text fields into a uniform format through systematic application of uppercase transformation, accent removal, and whitespace trimming. By analyzing JavaScript implementations from HDI and GNP normalization scripts, we demonstrate how these operations enhance data quality and interoperability in vehicle catalog homogenization systems.

## Core Text Normalization Process
The text standardization process involves three fundamental operations applied sequentially to ensure consistent formatting across all insurer data inputs. These operations are implemented in a reusable `normalizarTexto` function that serves as the foundation for data cleaning across multiple insurance providers.

The process begins with **uppercase transformation** using the `toUpperCase()` method, which eliminates case variations that could lead to false mismatches during data comparison. This is followed by **accent removal** through Unicode normalization (`normalize("NFD")`) combined with regular expression filtering (`/[\u0300-\u036f]/g`) to strip diacritical marks from characters. Finally, **whitespace trimming** is performed using `trim()` to remove leading and trailing spaces, while `replace(/\s+/g, " ")` collapses multiple internal spaces into single spaces.

This standardized approach ensures that text values such as "México" become "MEXICO", "café" becomes "CAFE", and "  multiple   spaces  " becomes "MULTIPLE SPACES", creating a consistent baseline for subsequent processing steps.

## Implementation in HDI and GNP Scripts
The HDI and GNP normalization scripts implement text standardization through identical core functions, demonstrating a consistent approach across different insurer data sources. Both scripts define a `normalizarTexto` function that applies the same sequence of JavaScript string operations to achieve uniform text formatting.

In the HDI script, the function appears in `hdi-codigo-de-normalizacion.js` and processes vehicle data fields such as brand, model, and version descriptions. The implementation follows the exact same pattern as the GNP script's `normalizarTexto` function in `gnp-codigo-de-normalizacion.js`, indicating a shared codebase or standardized approach across insurer integrations.

Both implementations use the same regular expression `/[^A-Z0-9\s-]/g` to replace non-alphanumeric characters (except spaces and hyphens) with spaces, ensuring that special characters do not interfere with data matching algorithms. This consistency across scripts enables reliable cross-insurer data comparison and reduces the risk of integration errors due to formatting discrepancies.

The standardized text processing is applied to various data fields including brand names, model descriptions, and version specifications, forming the foundation for subsequent normalization steps such as synonym resolution and technical specification extraction.

## Best Practices for Edge Cases
Handling edge cases in text standardization requires careful consideration of special characters, non-Latin scripts, and encoding issues that may arise in insurer data. The analyzed scripts demonstrate several best practices for addressing these challenges.

For **special characters**, the scripts use comprehensive regular expressions to handle various quote types and special symbols. The HDI script includes specific replacements for Unicode quotation marks (`\u201C`, `\u201D`, `\u2018`, `\u2019`) and angle quotes (`\u00AB`, `\u00BB`), ensuring consistent treatment of different quotation styles that may appear in source data.

Regarding **non-Latin scripts**, the normalization process relies on Unicode's NFD (Normalization Form Decomposition) to handle characters from various languages. This approach decomposes characters with diacritical marks into their base characters and combining marks, allowing for systematic removal of accents regardless of the original script.

For **encoding issues**, the scripts implement defensive programming practices such as null checking (`if (!texto) return ""`) and type conversion (`texto.toString()`), preventing runtime errors when encountering unexpected data types or null values. The use of `toUpperCase()` after string conversion ensures that case normalization works correctly even when input data types vary.

Additionally, the scripts handle **performance-sensitive operations** by minimizing the number of string manipulations and using efficient regular expressions. The order of operations is optimized to reduce computational overhead, with simpler operations like case conversion performed before more complex Unicode normalization.

### Door-to-Body Type Mapping
Recent updates to the vehicle homologation strategy have introduced a standardized mapping between door count and body type, enhancing the accuracy of vehicle classification across insurer data sources. This mapping is implemented in the normalization process to infer body type when explicit information is unavailable.

The door-to-body type mapping follows this standardized approach:
- **2 doors**: COUPE
- **3 doors**: HATCHBACK
- **4 doors**: SEDAN
- **5 doors**: SUV
- **6 doors**: SUV
- **7 doors**: SUV

This mapping is applied as a fallback mechanism when explicit body type information is not available in the source data. The HDI normalization script implements this logic in the `extraerEspecificaciones` function, where it uses door count to infer body type when no explicit body type designation exists. This approach ensures consistent vehicle classification across all insurer data sources, even when some providers lack explicit body type information.

The implementation can be seen in the HDI normalization script where door count is extracted from text patterns like "3 PUERTAS" or "5P" and then mapped to the corresponding body type according to the standard mapping above. This enhancement improves data consistency and enables more accurate vehicle matching across different insurance providers.

## Performance Implications
The performance implications of repeated string operations in batch processing are significant, particularly when handling large volumes of insurer data. The text standardization process, while essential for data consistency, introduces computational overhead that must be carefully managed in production environments.

Each string operation—`toUpperCase()`, `normalize()`, `replace()`, and `trim()`—creates a new string object in memory, leading to increased memory allocation and garbage collection pressure during batch processing. When applied to thousands of records, this can result in substantial performance degradation if not optimized.

The scripts mitigate these performance impacts through several strategies. First, they **reuse the same normalization function** across multiple data fields, reducing code duplication and enabling potential optimization by JavaScript engines. Second, they apply normalization **only when necessary**, using null checks to skip processing for empty or undefined values.

In batch processing scenarios, the cumulative effect of these string operations can be significant. For example, normalizing 10,000 vehicle records with multiple text fields each requires tens of thousands of individual string manipulations. This underscores the importance of efficient implementation and the potential benefits of parallel processing or batch optimization techniques.

The consistent implementation across HDI, GNP, and other insurer scripts suggests that performance considerations have been factored into the design, with a balance struck between thorough data cleaning and processing efficiency.

## Conclusion
Text standardization through uppercase transformation, accent removal, and whitespace trimming is a fundamental component of data normalization in insurer data integration. The analysis of HDI and GNP normalization scripts reveals a consistent and robust implementation of these operations using JavaScript's built-in string methods. By applying `toUpperCase()`, `normalize("NFD")` with regex accent removal, and `trim()` operations, these scripts ensure data consistency across diverse insurer sources. The standardized approach enables reliable data matching and comparison while addressing edge cases through comprehensive character handling and defensive programming. Performance considerations are addressed through efficient implementation and careful operation ordering, making this text normalization process suitable for large-scale batch processing in vehicle catalog homogenization systems.
